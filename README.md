# KMeans_project
In this project, I tried to divide Countries and regions into clusters based on a set of their main characteristics (GDP per capita, literacy, climate, etc.)
At the end of the project, a geographical visualization of the results was also made, but it cannot be displayed in a notebook without running the code. If you want to study it, try to divide the countries into more clusters, please download the notebook and attached datasets.
